# Golden Idol 

**Golden Idol** is an adventure game set in the modern world. 

As members of the Legendary Artifacts Recovery Agency (LARA), the group of characters will have to travel the world in search of ancient and mysterious artifacts, vestiges of lost civilizations. 

In the depths of rainforests, among the world's highest mountains, in the hidden oases of deserts, on plateaus, in the depths of the sea. Ancient ruins are hidden everywhere.

But beware. Secret societies and enemy agencies will get in your way!
