# Golden Idol System Reference Document (v.1.0)

**Golden Idol** is an adventure game set in the modern world. You are members of LARA (Legendary Artifacts Recovery Agency), charged with discovering and finding valuable artifacts around the world in remote places, among the ruins of lost civilizations. 
But beware. Secret societies and enemy agencies will get in your way!

**Golden Idol** is based on *Cairn* by Yochai Gal and licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  

## Overview

**Golden Idol** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality  
The Referee's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Fiction First  
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Referee in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Foreground Growth  
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice  
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles  
The Referee and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Referees

### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus  
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger  
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Artifacts  
- An Artifact is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- An Artifact is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Use Artifacts as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice  
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate  
- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

## Principles for Players

### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Referee's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Principles of the World

### Adventure
- The team is a group of characters seeking out new and exciting experiences.
- They band together to overcoming challenges and obstacles.
- The world is full of unknown and dangerous locations, lost civilizations and their remains.

### Artifacts
- Lost civilizations and other parties left behind mysterious and powerful artifacts.
- They are sought after by others for their inscrutable purposes.
- Artifacts must be recovered and protected before they fall into the wrong hands.

### Lost Civilization
- Human history is a mystery of which only a few pieces are known.
- There have been dozens if not hundreds of civilizations that have disappeared into oblivion.
- Many of them remain unknown to the public. Their remains await exploration.

### Secret Societies
- There are secret societies and organizations sometimes malevolent sometimes enigmatic.
- They collect artifacts to study them and reveal their mysterious powers.
- They are often entrenched in society and will serve any means to achieve their purposes.

### Globetrotting
- Artifacts are scattered in exotic and remote locations around the world.
- The team must face the unique challenges and opportunities of each location.
- It is necessary to adapt to and immerse oneself in different cultures and environments to succeed.

### The Unexplained
- The team will often find itself investigating and seeking answers to mysterious and supernatural occurrences.
- They will study the extraordinary and bizarre events and phenomena in the world.
- With they work they protect the world from the malicious use of these phenomena.

## Character Creation

### 1. Ability Scores  
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. 

When creating a PC, the player roll 4d6 keeping the 3 highest results for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

### 2. Hit Protection  
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](/Golden Idol-srd#scars-1) table.

### 3. Starting Gear
All PCs begin with:

- Civilian clothes
- Expedition clothes
- Bulletproof vest
- Standard firearm
- Smartphone
- 3d6 x 500 $

The group also have an adequate transport for the mission.

## Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Referee's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory.  **Assistants** can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Vehicles

Like creatures, vehicles have three abilities used to make saves.
- **Integrity** (INT): General stability, used to crash safely, smash through things, and resist Critical Damage. Equivalent to STR for creatures.
- **Engines** (ENG): Ability to move, speed up, dodge, and stunts. Equivalent to DEX for creatures.
- **Gauges** (GAU): Mechanical control components. Used to maintain routes, stabilize assets, etc. Equivalent to WIL for creatures.

Vehicles also possess:
- Hull Points (**HP**) which reflect their ability to avoid damage in combat.
- **Armor** which reduces damage (max 3) before affecting HP.
- **Load**, the capacity of the vehicle:
  - 1 slot per person or 100lb of weight.
  - Exceeding the total value of Load, the vehicle is overloaded and it is unable to recover HP or ability scores.

**Damage** that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's INT by the amount remaining. 
- They must then make a INT save to avoid critical damage. 
- Any vehicle that suffers critical damage trudges and spits oil. If left unrepaired, it is destroyed within the 1d20 minutes.
- A vehicle with zero INT is totaled.

| Type                | Armor | HP  | INT | ENG | GAU | Load | Cost ($)  |

## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see **saves**, below).

**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

### Saves
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

> **Example**
> _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success!_

### Healing
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss (see **Critical Damage**) can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot). PCs can also gain Fatigue by **casting spells** or through events in the fiction.

### Armor
Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according to their use.

### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Referee may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
|:-------:|:----:|:-------:|:----:|:-------:|
|    2    |  3-5 |   6-8   | 9-11 |    12   |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Assistants
PCs can hire **Assistants** to aid them in their expeditions. To create a hireling, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out. Assistants cost between 1-3gp per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

### Wealth & Treasure
The most common coin is the gold piece (gp), which is equal to 10 silver pieces (sp) and 100 copper pieces (cp).

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

## Combat

### Rounds
The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of turns.

### Actions  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Referee calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

### Turns
The Referee will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters. At the start of combat, each PC must make a DEX save to act before their opponents.

> **Example**
> _Bea has accidentally stumbled onto the stomping grounds of a massive Wood Troll. In order to make a move before the Troll, she makes a DEX save. She fails, and the Troll gets to attack first._

### Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

> **Example**
> _The Wood Troll roars, swinging its club at Bea, who has 5 HP. The club does 1d10 damage and the Referee rolls a 4. They subtract 1 to account for Bea's  leather armor, leaving Bea with 2 HP remaining_.

### Multiple Attackers  
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

### Dual Damage
If attacking with two weapons at the same time or the the weapon grants more than one damage dice, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Blast  
Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's STR by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score Loss
If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.
Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.  

### Scars
When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the [**Scars**](/Golden Idol-srd#scars-1) table for more.

### Unconsciousness & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).  
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

### Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Scars
When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total damage taken:

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 5   | Diseased: You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                           |
| 6   | Reorienting Head Wound: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current ability score, take the new result.                                                              |
| 7   | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result.                                                              |
| 8   | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |
| 9   | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.                                                                                    |
| 10  | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The Referee will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                                |
| 11  | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.                                                                         |
| 12  | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

### Creating Creatures
Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or NPC:

**Name**
X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
- Special effect or critical damage consequence

**General Principles**  
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.  
- Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious threats get 10+ HP.
- Use flavor and style to help them stand out.
- Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Remember that HP is **Hit Protection** , not Hit Points. It's a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

# Rules Summary

**ACTIONS**  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

**ABILITIES**  
**STR:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.   
**DEX:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.   
**WIL:**  Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

**SAVES**  
- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.
- 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.

**HIT PROTECTION**  
**HP** indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment's rest.

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an increase in slots.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

**HEALING**  
A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a medic.

**COMBAT**  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the [**Scars**](/Golden Idol-srd#scars-1) table.
 
Damage that reduces a target's HP **below** 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage.**  Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death;** having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.

## Appendix A: Example Secret Societies

# Secret Societies

## Order of the Crimson Sun

The secret society, known as the "Order of the Crimson Sun," is a centuries-old organization shrouded in mystery and legend. Its members are drawn from the upper echelons of society, including the wealthy and powerful, as well as those with exceptional talent and intelligence. The exact purpose and activities of the Order are known only to its members, and it is rumored that they possess ancient knowledge and technology beyond the understanding of the general public.

The membership of the Order is strictly secretive, with members taking a vow of silence upon joining. Those who attempt to reveal the secrets of the Order are swiftly dealt with, and the full extent of the society's power is unknown. It is said that the Order has a network of agents and operatives spread throughout the world, working to further the society's mysterious goals.

The headquarters of the Order is located in a hidden underground complex, guarded by impenetrable security measures. It is said that within the complex lies a vast library of ancient texts and artifacts, as well as advanced technology that is used by the society for its secretive purposes.

Despite its secretive nature, the Order has been known to make its presence known from time to time, sometimes intervening in world events in ways that are not easily understood. Some believe that the Order is working towards a greater good, while others see it as a dangerous and sinister force. Whatever the truth may be, the Order of the Crimson Sun remains an enigma, shrouded in mystery and intrigue.

They are said to have infiltrated governments and institutions around the world, and to be working behind the scenes to shape global events. The society's symbol is the eye of Horus, and its members are rumored to be able to communicate telepathically through their shared connection to the Silent Eye.

The Silent Eye is shrouded in mystery and secrecy, even among its members. It is said to have been founded by a group of ancient Egyptian mystics who discovered a powerful source of psychic energy. Over the centuries, the Eye has evolved and adapted, always working to protect and wield this mysterious power.

Members of the Eye are chosen for their exceptional intelligence, cunning, and discretion. They undergo rigorous mental and physical training to hone their psychic abilities and develop their senses. The Eye is said to have a complex hierarchy, with each member belonging to one of several ranks depending on their abilities and accomplishments.

The Eye's symbol is the eye of Horus, and its members are rumored to be able to communicate telepathically through their shared connection to the Silent Eye.

Some say that it is a benevolent force for good, while others believe that it is a nefarious and dangerous organization that seeks to control and manipulate the world for its own gain. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain: The Eternal Flame is a force to be reckoned with, and its influence and power cannot be underestimated.
