## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see **saves**, below).

**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, use of artifacts, etc.

### Saves
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

> **Example**
> _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 â€“ a success!_

### Healing
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss (see **Critical Damage**) can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot). PCs can also gain Fatigue by **casting spells** or through events in the fiction.

### Armor
Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according to their use.

### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Referee may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
|:-------:|:----:|:-------:|:----:|:-------:|
|    2    |  3-5 |   6-8   | 9-11 |    12   |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Assistants
PCs can hire **Assistants** to aid them in their expeditions. To create an assistant, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out. Assistants cost between 1-3gp per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

### Wealth & Artifacts
The common currency is the dollar ($).

An Artifact is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.
