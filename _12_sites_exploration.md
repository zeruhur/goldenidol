## Sites Exploration
1. Research the site: Just like with globetrotting adventures, research the history and culture of the site to create a believable and immersive setting.
2. Incorporate puzzles and mysteries: Many lost civilizations and ancient sites are full of puzzles and mysteries for the players to solve. These can include deciphering inscriptions, navigating mazes, or solving riddles.
3. Create a sense of danger: The players are exploring ancient and potentially dangerous ruins, so make sure to include hazards and traps that can put them in danger.
4. Incorporate supernatural elements: The unexplained and supernatural is a key element of the game, so consider including elements of the supernatural in the adventure, such as cursed artifacts or supernatural guardians.
5. Incorporate conflicts with secret societies and organizations: Just like in globetrotting adventures, these groups can provide a source of conflict and tension as they may be working against the players to acquire the same artifacts.
