## Character Creation

### 1. Ability Scores  
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. 

When creating a PC, the player roll 4d6 keeping the 3 highest results for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

### 2. Hit Protection  
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](/Golden Idol-srd#scars-1) table.

### 3. Starting Gear
All PCs begin with:

- Civilian clothes
- Expedition clothes
- Bulletproof vest
- Standard firearm
- Smartphone
- 3d6 x 500 $

The group also have an adequate transport for the mission.

### 4. Name
Choose or roll (1d20) your PCâ€™s **name**
