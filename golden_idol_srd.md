## Overview

**Golden Idol** was written with the following design philosophies in
mind:

### Neutrality

The Referee’s role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and
narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Death

Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its
many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or
without warning.

### Fiction First

Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome.
Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Referee in dialogue
with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Foreground Growth

Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills
and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice

Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve
made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely
and frequently.

### Principles

The Referee and the players each have guidelines that help foster a
specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and
an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives

Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character
goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working
together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Referees

### Information

  - Provide useful information about the game world as the characters
    explore it.
  - Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
  - Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
  - Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know
    they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty

  - Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
  - If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll
    will allow them to do it.
  - Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation
    sensible? Let it happen.
  - Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all
    that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation

  - The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and
    makes sharp turns.
  - Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories
    or plots.
  - NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the
    world.
  - NPCs don’t want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to
    live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus

  - Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character
    abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to
    facilitate improvement and specialization.
  - Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put
    realistic opportunities in their path.
  - A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive
    armor and impressive training.

### Danger

  - The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player
    characters.
  - Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more
    dangerous, the more obvious.
  - Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out
    a solution.
  - Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the
    world.

### Artifacts

  - An Artifact is specific to the environment from where it is
    recovered. It tells a story.
  - An Artifact is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely
    useful beyond its worth and prestige.
  - Use Artifacts as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of
    intimidating foes.

### Choice

  - Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation
    lulls.
  - Use binary “so, A or B?” responses when their intentions are vague.
  - Work together using this conversational method to keep the game
    moving.
  - Ensure that the player character’s actions leave their mark on the
    game world.

### Die of Fate

  - Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the
    weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
  - In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors
    the players.
  - A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their
    allies.

## Principles for Players

### Agency

  - Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are
    tools.
  - Don’t ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do,
    too.
  - Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork

  - Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
  - Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other
    and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration

  - Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any
    stats, items, or skills you have.
  - Take the Referee’s description without suspicion, but don’t shy away
    from seeking more information.
  - There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking

  - Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity
    to safely gain information and solve problems.
  - You’ll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk
    things through before getting violent.

### Caution

  - Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether
    violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
  - Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem
    unfavorable.

### Planning

  - Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance,
    subtlety, and fact-finding.
  - Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition

  - Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
  - Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
  - Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Principles of the World

### Adventure

  - The team is a group of characters seeking out new and exciting
    experiences.
  - They band together to overcoming challenges and obstacles.
  - The world is full of unknown and dangerous locations, lost
    civilizations and their remains.

### Artifacts

  - Lost civilizations and other parties left behind mysterious and
    powerful artifacts.
  - They are sought after by others for their inscrutable purposes.
  - Artifacts must be recovered and protected before they fall into the
    wrong hands.

### Lost Civilization

  - Human history is a mystery of which only a few pieces are known.
  - There have been dozens if not hundreds of civilizations that have
    disappeared into oblivion.
  - Many of them remain unknown to the public. Their remains await
    exploration.

### Secret Societies

  - There are secret societies and organizations sometimes malevolent
    sometimes enigmatic.
  - They collect artifacts to study them and reveal their mysterious
    powers.
  - They are often entrenched in society and will serve any means to
    achieve their purposes.

### Globetrotting

  - Artifacts are scattered in exotic and remote locations around the
    world.
  - The team must face the unique challenges and opportunities of each
    location.
  - It is necessary to adapt to and immerse oneself in different
    cultures and environments to succeed.

### The Unexplained

  - The team will often find itself investigating and seeking answers to
    mysterious and supernatural occurrences.
  - They will study the extraordinary and bizarre events and phenomena
    in the world.
  - With they work they protect the world from the malicious use of
    these phenomena.

## Character Creation

### 1\. Ability Scores

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**.

When creating a PC, the player roll 4d6 keeping the 3 highest results
for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then
swap any two of the results.

### 2\. Hit Protection

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC’s starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which
reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a
character’s health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see
**Healing**). If an attack takes a PC’s HP exactly to 0, the player must
roll on the [**Scars**](/Golden%20Idol-srd#scars-1) table.

### 3\. Starting Gear

All PCs begin with:

  - Civilian clothes
  - Expedition clothes

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together.

## Vehicles

Like creatures, vehicles have three abilities used to make saves. -
**Integrity** (INT): General stability, used to crash safely, smash
through things, and resist Critical Damage. Equivalent to STR for
creatures. - **Engines** (ENG): Ability to move, speed up, dodge, and
stunts. Equivalent to DEX for creatures. - **Gauges** (GAU): Mechanical
control components. Used to maintain routes, stabilize assets, etc.
Equivalent to WIL for creatures.

Vehicles also possess: - Hull Points (**HP**) which reflect their
ability to avoid damage in combat. - **Armor** which reduces damage (max
3) before affecting HP. - **Load**, the capacity of the vehicle: - 1
slot per person or 100lb of weight. - Exceeding the total value of Load,
the vehicle is overloaded and it is unable to recover HP or ability
scores.

**Damage** that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s
INT by the amount remaining. - They must then make a INT save to avoid
critical damage. - Any vehicle that suffers critical damage trudges and
spits oil. If left unrepaired, it is destroyed within the 1d20 minutes.
- A vehicle with zero INT is totaled.

| Type                | Armor | HP | INT | ENG | GAU | Load | Cost ($)  |

## Rules

### Abilities

Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see
**saves**, below).

**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like
lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes
like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate,
intimidate, charm, provoke, use of artifacts, etc.

### Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and
circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they
roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they
fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

> **Example** *Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing
> guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course,
> recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best
> option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success\!*

### Healing

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP
but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss (see **Critical Damage**) can
usually be restored with a week’s rest facilitated by a healer or other
appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services are free, while
magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Deprivation & Fatigue

A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to
recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds
**Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies
one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full
night’s rest in a safe spot). PCs can also gain Fatigue by **casting
spells** or through events in the fiction.

### Armor

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor** value
from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a
bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or
worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according
to their use.

### Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not
obvious, the Referee may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale

Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first
casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use
their leader’s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when
they’re reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Assistants

PCs can hire **Assistants** to aid them in their expeditions. To create
an assistant, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and
a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character
Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out.
Assistants cost between 1-3gp per day, or a share of whatever treasure
the party obtains.

### Wealth & Artifacts

The common currency is the dollar ($).

An Artifact is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond
its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous
locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

## Combat

### Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or
circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when
something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and
is comprised of turns.

### Actions

On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one
action. This may be using an artifact, attacking, making a second move,
or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled.
If a character attempts something risky, the Referee calls for a save
for appropriate players or NPCs.

### Turns

The Referee will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or
monsters. At the start of combat, each PC must make a DEX save to act
before their opponents.

### Attacking & Damage

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor,
then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP. Unarmed attacks
always do 1d4 damage.

### Multiple Attackers

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep
the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers

If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with
bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4
damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe
or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the
attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

### Dual Damage

If attacking with two weapons at the same time or the the weapon grants
more than one damage dice, roll all damage dice and keep the single
highest result.

### Blast

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area,
rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything
from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a
meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related
damage die for a result.

### Critical Damage

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s STR by
the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical
damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or
effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage
save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly,
grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left
untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score Loss

If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0,
they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.
Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they
are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

### Scars

When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes
changed irrevocably. See the [**Scars**](/Golden%20Idol-srd#scars-1)
table for more.

### Unconsciousness & Death

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or
take control of an assistant. They immediately join the party in order
to reduce downtime.

### Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a
single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is
routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is
destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding
blast damage).  
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal
blast damage.

### Retreat

Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX
save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Scars

When an attack reduces a PC’s HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely
impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total
damage taken:

|    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Lasting Scar: Roll 1d6                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2  | Rattling Blow: You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                           |
| 3  | Walloped: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP.                                                         |
| 4  | Broken Limb: Roll 1d6                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5  | Diseased: You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                           |
| 6  | Reorienting Head Wound: Roll 1d6                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7  | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result.                                                              |
| 8  | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |
| 9  | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.                                                                                    |
| 10 | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The Referee will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                               |
| 11 | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.                                                                         |
| 12 | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

### Get Inspired

Here are some suggestions for building your adventure:

1.  **Research the places involved**: Get a sense of the culture,
    history, and geography of the places the characters will visit. This
    will help you create a believable and immersive setting for the
    adventure.
2.  **Make use of the Pointcrawl model**: This model emphasizes the use
    of points of interest, rather than a linear path, to guide the
    players through the adventure. This allows for greater flexibility
    and player agency in the way the adventure unfolds.
3.  **Create a variety of challenges and obstacles**: As the players
    travel to different locations, they should encounter a variety of
    challenges that reflect the unique aspects of each location. These
    can include environmental hazards, cultural barriers, or conflicts
    with locals.
4.  **Incorporate artifacts and lost civilizations**: The primary goal
    of the players is to discover and recover artifacts, so make sure to
    include opportunities for them to do so in the adventure. Lost
    civilizations and their remains can also be a source of interesting
    puzzles and mysteries for the players to solve.
5.  **Consider the impact of secret societies and organizations**: These
    groups can provide a source of conflict and tension throughout the
    adventure, as they may be working against the players to acquire the
    same artifacts.

### Adventure Creation Guidelines

If you run out of ideas use the guidelines below for inspiration or make
your adventure from scratch:

1.  **Determine the location of the adventure**: Roll a d10 to randomly
    select a location from a list of possible locations around the
    world.

By using these mechanical rules, you can randomly generate a unique and
exciting globetrotting adventure in Golden Idol that incorporates the
key elements of the game, such as artifacts, lost civilizations, secret
societies, and the unexplained and supernatural.

### A More Cinematic Guideline

Golden Idol is a “fiction first” game where events and situations
interacting with characters through their actions make a narrative
emerge. This is why I strongly advise against writing a “plot” for the
characters to follow: create situations and obstacles and let events
unfold. But if you can’t resist the temptation to at least give the
adventure an outline, consider the following suggestions for a classic
three-act story.

I just urge you not to consider them rigid or mandatory.

1.  Introduction:
      - Establish the main objective of the adventure clearly and
        concisely.
      - Provide the players with enough information about the location
        and any relevant background information to immerse them in the
        setting.
      - Introduce any key NPCs or organizations that will be involved in
        the adventure.
      - Provide the players with a sense of urgency or motivation to
        start the adventure.
      - Give the players a clear starting point and a general idea of
        where they should go next, but also leave room for exploration
        and player agency.
2.  Middle:
      - Allow the players to explore the location and discover points of
        interest on their own.
      - Introduce challenges and obstacles that are appropriate for the
        location and the main objective of the adventure.
      - Provide opportunities for the players to discover and recover
        artifacts.
      - Incorporate secret societies or organizations as appropriate and
        make sure they have clear motives and goals.
      - Keep the players engaged by providing a sense of progression and
        by keeping them on their toes with unexpected twists and turns.
3.  Conclusion:
      - Provide a satisfying resolution to the main objective of the
        adventure.
      - Allow the players to reflect on their accomplishments and the
        impact of their actions on the world.
      - Provide a sense of closure, but also leave room for the
        possibility of further adventures.
      - Reward the players for their actions and provide opportunities
        for them to advance their characters and acquire new abilities
        or artifacts.
      - Provide the players with a clear idea of what happens next and
        what their next steps should be.

## Sites Exploration

### Get Inspired

    research the history and culture of the site to create a believable
    and immersive setting.
2.  **Incorporate puzzles and mysteries**: Many lost civilizations and
    ancient sites are full of puzzles and mysteries for the players to
    solve. These can include deciphering inscriptions, navigating mazes,

    potentially dangerous ruins, so make sure to include hazards and
    traps that can put them in danger.

    elements of the supernatural in the adventure, such as cursed
    artifacts or supernatural guardians.

    and obstacles.

You could also make the society’s headquarters or one of their hidden
bases the location of the Site Exploration, with the objective to
infiltrate, steal information or artifact from them, or sabotage their
plans.

### The Wallet Site Method

Create the site by rolling a handful of d6s and assemble based on
results:

|   |                                              |
| - | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Dead End: Cannot touch more than 1 die       |
| 2 | Passage: Cannot touch more than 2 dice       |
| 3 | Split: Cannot touch more than 3 dice         |
| 4 | Crossroads: Can touch up to 4 dice           |
| 5 | Tower: Stack all, must touch at least 2 dice |
| 6 | Hall: Merge all, can touch up to 4 dice      |

For each die, add its value to all neighboring dice to determine its
room. Halls and Towers are single rooms with all their dice summed.

|       |             |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 3     | Quarters    |
| 4     | Jail        |
| 5     | Sepulchre   |
| 6     | Statuary    |
| 7     | Store Room  |
| 8     | Courtyard   |
| 9     | Kitchen     |
| 10    | Forge       |
| 11    | Armory      |
| 12    | Garden      |
| 13    | Guard Post  |
| 14    | Library     |
| 15    | Arboretum   |
| 16    | Crypts      |
| 17    | Shrine      |
| 18    | Gallery     |
| 19    | Workshop    |
| 20-22 | Temple      |
| 23-25 | Throne Room |
| 26-28 | Laboratory  |
| 29-31 | Menagerie   |
| 32+   | Labyrinth   |

Place an entrance where it makes sense.

For extra detail, modify each room based on lowest/highest neighboring
die.

| 1 2 3 | Lowest      | 4 5 6 | Highest       |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 2     | Secret Exit | 1     | Ornate        |
| 3     | Trapped     | 2     | Pristine      |
| 4     | Crumbling   | 3     | Opulent       |
| 5     | Flooded     | 4     | Hidden Alcove |
| 6     | Damp        | 5     | Locked        |

Roll an **encounter** in each room:

|   |                              |
| - | ---------------------------- |
| 1 | Threat: Active harm          |
| 2 | Obstacle: Passive harm       |
| 3 | Nothing: A moment of respite |
| 4 | Nothing: A moment of respite |
| 5 | Opportunity: Obstacle + Boon |
| 6 | Boon: Helpful or valuable    |

**Tower**: Roll an encounter for each floor, then order them from lowest
to highest.

**Hall**: Roll an encounter for each die in the Hall and combine them.

-----

### Creating Creatures

Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or
NPC:

**Name** X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special items,
qualities) - Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor - Quirk,
tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique - Special effect or
critical damage consequence

**General Principles**  
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is
noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.  
\- Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious
threats get 10+ HP. - Use flavor and style to help them stand out. - Use
critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive
NPC. - Remember that HP is **Hit Protection** , not Hit Points. It’s a
measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

## Rules Summary

**ACTIONS**  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one
action. Actions may include using an artifact, attacking, making a
second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and
movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain,
the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful
DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

**ABILITIES**  
**STR:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.  
**DEX:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.  
**WIL:** Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

**SAVES**  
\- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability. - 1 is always a success, 20
is always a failure.

**HIT PROTECTION**  
**HP** indicates a PC’s ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during
combat & recovered after a few moment’s rest.

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their
backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a
one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two
slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more
than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an
increase in slots.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they
add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts
until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

**HEALING**  
A moment’s rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave
the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week’s rest and the
aid of a medic.

**COMBAT**  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s Armor,
then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor** value
from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a
bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers**
target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest
result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both
damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4,
regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker rolls
1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets,
rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the
[**Scars**](/Golden%20Idol-srd#scars-1) table.

Damage that reduces a target’s HP **below** 0 decreases their STR by the
remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage.**
Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death;** having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is
delirium.

## Appendix A: Secret Societies

The secret society known as the “Order of the Crimson Sun” is a
centuries-old organization shrouded in mystery and legend. Its members

and it is rumored that they possess ancient knowledge and technology
beyond the understanding of the general public.

The membership of the Order is strictly secretive, with members taking a
vow of silence upon joining. Those who attempt to reveal the secrets of
the Order are swiftly dealt with, and the full extent of the society’s
power is unknown. It is said that the Order has a network of agents and
operatives spread throughout the world, working to further the society’s
mysterious goals.

The headquarters of the Order is located in a hidden underground
complex, guarded by impenetrable security measures. It is said that
within the complex lies a vast library of ancient texts and artifacts,
as well as advanced technology that is used by the society for its
secretive purposes.

Despite its secretive nature, the Order has been known to make its
presence known from time to time, sometimes intervening in world events
in ways that are not easily understood. Some believe that the Order is
working towards a greater good, while others see it as a dangerous and
sinister force. Whatever the truth may be, the Order of the Crimson Sun
remains an enigma, shrouded in mystery and intrigue.

travel and are using this knowledge to further the Eye’s goals.

secrecy. Its members are sworn to secrecy about its existence, and only

symbol is the eye of Horus, and its members are rumored to be able to
communicate telepathically through their shared connection to the Silent
Eye.

System Reference Document v.1.0.0

## Overview

**Golden Idol** was written with the following design philosophies in
mind:

### Neutrality

The Referee’s role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and
narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Death

Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its
many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or
without warning.

### Fiction First

Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome.
Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Referee in dialogue
with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Foreground Growth

Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills
and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice

Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve
made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely
and frequently.

### Principles

The Referee and the players each have guidelines that help foster a
specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and
an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives

Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character
goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working
together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Referees

### Information

  - Provide useful information about the game world as the characters
    explore it.
  - Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
  - Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
  - Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know
    they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty

  - Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
  - If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll
    will allow them to do it.
  - Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation
    sensible? Let it happen.
  - Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all
    that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation

  - The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and
    makes sharp turns.
  - Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories
    or plots.
  - NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the
    world.
  - NPCs don’t want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to
    live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus

  - Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character
    abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to
    facilitate improvement and specialization.
  - Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put
    realistic opportunities in their path.
  - A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive
    armor and impressive training.

### Danger

  - The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player
    characters.
  - Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more
    dangerous, the more obvious.
  - Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out
    a solution.
  - Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the
    world.

### Artifacts

  - An Artifact is specific to the environment from where it is
    recovered. It tells a story.
  - An Artifact is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely
    useful beyond its worth and prestige.
  - Use Artifacts as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of
    intimidating foes.

### Choice

  - Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation
    lulls.
  - Use binary “so, A or B?” responses when their intentions are vague.
  - Work together using this conversational method to keep the game
    moving.
  - Ensure that the player character’s actions leave their mark on the
    game world.

### Die of Fate

  - Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the
    weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
  - In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors
    the players.
  - A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their
    allies.

## Principles for Players

### Agency

  - Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are
    tools.
  - Don’t ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do,
    too.
  - Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork

  - Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
  - Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other
    and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration

  - Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any
    stats, items, or skills you have.
  - Take the Referee’s description without suspicion, but don’t shy away
    from seeking more information.
  - There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking

  - Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity
    to safely gain information and solve problems.
  - You’ll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk
    things through before getting violent.

### Caution

  - Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether
    violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
  - Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem
    unfavorable.

### Planning

  - Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance,
    subtlety, and fact-finding.
  - Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition

  - Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
  - Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
  - Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Principles of the World

### Adventure

  - The team is a group of characters seeking out new and exciting
    experiences.
  - They band together to overcoming challenges and obstacles.
  - The world is full of unknown and dangerous locations, lost
    civilizations and their remains.

### Artifacts

  - Lost civilizations and other parties left behind mysterious and
    powerful artifacts.
  - They are sought after by others for their inscrutable purposes.
  - Artifacts must be recovered and protected before they fall into the
    wrong hands.

### Lost Civilization

  - Human history is a mystery of which only a few pieces are known.
  - There have been dozens if not hundreds of civilizations that have
    disappeared into oblivion.
  - Many of them remain unknown to the public. Their remains await
    exploration.

### Secret Societies

  - There are secret societies and organizations sometimes malevolent
    sometimes enigmatic.
  - They collect artifacts to study them and reveal their mysterious
    powers.
  - They are often entrenched in society and will serve any means to
    achieve their purposes.

### Globetrotting

  - Artifacts are scattered in exotic and remote locations around the
    world.
  - The team must face the unique challenges and opportunities of each
    location.
  - It is necessary to adapt to and immerse oneself in different
    cultures and environments to succeed.

### The Unexplained

  - The team will often find itself investigating and seeking answers to
    mysterious and supernatural occurrences.
  - They will study the extraordinary and bizarre events and phenomena
    in the world.
  - With they work they protect the world from the malicious use of
    these phenomena.

## Character Creation

### 1\. Ability Scores

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**.

When creating a PC, the player roll 4d6 keeping the 3 highest results
for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then
swap any two of the results.

### 2\. Hit Protection

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC’s starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which
reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a
character’s health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see
**Healing**). If an attack takes a PC’s HP exactly to 0, the player must
roll on the [**Scars**](/Golden%20Idol-srd#scars-1) table.

### 3\. Starting Gear

All PCs begin with:

  - Civilian clothes
  - Expedition clothes
  - Bulletproof vest
  - Standard firearm

emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together.
Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Referee’s discretion.

## Vehicles

Like creatures, vehicles have three abilities used to make saves. -
**Integrity** (INT): General stability, used to crash safely, smash
through things, and resist Critical Damage. Equivalent to STR for
creatures. - **Engines** (ENG): Ability to move, speed up, dodge, and
stunts. Equivalent to DEX for creatures. - **Gauges** (GAU): Mechanical
control components. Used to maintain routes, stabilize assets, etc.
Equivalent to WIL for creatures.

Vehicles also possess: - Hull Points (**HP**) which reflect their
ability to avoid damage in combat. - **Armor** which reduces damage (max
3) before affecting HP. - **Load**, the capacity of the vehicle: - 1
slot per person or 100lb of weight. - Exceeding the total value of Load,
the vehicle is overloaded and it is unable to recover HP or ability
scores.

**Damage** that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s
INT by the amount remaining. - They must then make a INT save to avoid
critical damage. - Any vehicle that suffers critical damage trudges and
spits oil. If left unrepaired, it is destroyed within the 1d20 minutes.
- A vehicle with zero INT is totaled.

| Type                | Armor | HP | INT | ENG | GAU | Load | Cost ($)  |

## Rules

### Abilities

Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see
**saves**, below).

**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like
lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes
like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate,
intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

### Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and
circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they
roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they
fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

> **Example** *Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing
> guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course,
> recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best
> option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success\!*

### Healing

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP
but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss (see **Critical Damage**) can
usually be restored with a week’s rest facilitated by a healer or other
appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services are free, while
magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Deprivation & Fatigue

A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to
recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds
**Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies
one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full
night’s rest in a safe spot). PCs can also gain Fatigue by **casting
spells** or through events in the fiction.

### Armor

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor** value
from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a
bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or
worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according
to their use.

### Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not
obvious, the Referee may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale

Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first
casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use
their leader’s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when
they’re reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Assistants

PCs can hire **Assistants** to aid them in their expeditions. To create
an assistant, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and
a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character
Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out.
Assistants cost between 1-3gp per day, or a share of whatever treasure
the party obtains.

### Wealth & Artifacts

The common currency is the dollar ($).

An Artifact is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond
its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous
locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

## Combat

### Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or
circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when
something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and
is comprised of turns.

### Actions

On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one
action. This may be using an artifact, attacking, making a second move,
or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled.
If a character attempts something risky, the Referee calls for a save
for appropriate players or NPCs.

### Turns

The Referee will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or
monsters. At the start of combat, each PC must make a DEX save to act
before their opponents.

### Attacking & Damage

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor,
then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP. Unarmed attacks
always do 1d4 damage.

### Multiple Attackers

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep
the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers

If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with
bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4
damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe
or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the
attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

### Dual Damage

If attacking with two weapons at the same time or the the weapon grants
more than one damage dice, roll all damage dice and keep the single
highest result.

### Blast

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area,
rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything
from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a
meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related
damage die for a result.

### Critical Damage

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s STR by
the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical
damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or
effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage
save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly,
grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left
untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score Loss

If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0,
they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.
Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they
are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

### Scars

When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes
changed irrevocably. See the [**Scars**](/Golden%20Idol-srd#scars-1)
table for more.

### Unconsciousness & Death

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or
take control of an assistant. They immediately join the party in order
to reduce downtime.

### Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a
single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is
routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is
destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding
blast damage).  
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal
blast damage.

### Retreat

Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX
save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Scars

When an attack reduces a PC’s HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely
impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total
damage taken:

|    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Lasting Scar: Roll 1d6                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2  | Rattling Blow: You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                           |
| 3  | Walloped: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP.                                                         |
| 4  | Broken Limb: Roll 1d6                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5  | Diseased: You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                           |
| 6  | Reorienting Head Wound: Roll 1d6                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7  | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result.                                                              |
| 8  | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |
| 9  | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.                                                                                    |
| 10 | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The Referee will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                               |
| 11 | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.                                                                         |
| 12 | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

### Get Inspired

Here are some suggestions for building your adventure:

1.  **Research the places involved**: Get a sense of the culture,
    history, and geography of the places the characters will visit. This
    will help you create a believable and immersive setting for the
    adventure.
2.  **Make use of the Pointcrawl model**: This model emphasizes the use
    of points of interest, rather than a linear path, to guide the
    players through the adventure. This allows for greater flexibility
    and player agency in the way the adventure unfolds.
3.  **Create a variety of challenges and obstacles**: As the players
    travel to different locations, they should encounter a variety of
    challenges that reflect the unique aspects of each location. These
    can include environmental hazards, cultural barriers, or conflicts
    with locals.
4.  **Incorporate artifacts and lost civilizations**: The primary goal
    of the players is to discover and recover artifacts, so make sure to
    include opportunities for them to do so in the adventure. Lost
    civilizations and their remains can also be a source of interesting
    puzzles and mysteries for the players to solve.
5.  **Consider the impact of secret societies and organizations**: These
    groups can provide a source of conflict and tension throughout the
    adventure, as they may be working against the players to acquire the
    same artifacts.

### Adventure Creation Guidelines

If you run out of ideas use the guidelines below for inspiration or make
your adventure from scratch:

1.  **Determine the location of the adventure**: Roll a d10 to randomly
    select a location from a list of possible locations around the
    world.

3.  **Determine the challenges and obstacles**: Roll a d6 to randomly
    select a type of challenge or obstacle that the players will
    encounter during the adventure.

|   |                                                                        |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Environmental hazards (e.g. extreme temperatures, treacherous terrain) |
| 2 | Conflicts with locals (e.g. hostile tribes, bandits)                   |
| 3 | Puzzles and riddles to solve                                           |

By using these mechanical rules, you can randomly generate a unique and
exciting globetrotting adventure in Golden Idol that incorporates the
key elements of the game, such as artifacts, lost civilizations, secret
societies, and the unexplained and supernatural.

### A More Cinematic Guideline

Golden Idol is a “fiction first” game where events and situations
interacting with characters through their actions make a narrative
emerge. This is why I strongly advise against writing a “plot” for the
characters to follow: create situations and obstacles and let events
unfold. But if you can’t resist the temptation to at least give the
adventure an outline, consider the following suggestions for a classic
three-act story.

I just urge you not to consider them rigid or mandatory.

1.  Introduction:
      - Establish the main objective of the adventure clearly and
        concisely.
      - Provide the players with enough information about the location
        and any relevant background information to immerse them in the
        setting.
      - Introduce any key NPCs or organizations that will be involved in
        the adventure.
      - Provide the players with a sense of urgency or motivation to
        start the adventure.
      - Give the players a clear starting point and a general idea of
        where they should go next, but also leave room for exploration
        and player agency.
2.  Middle:
      - Allow the players to explore the location and discover points of
        interest on their own.
      - Introduce challenges and obstacles that are appropriate for the
        location and the main objective of the adventure.
      - Provide opportunities for the players to discover and recover
        artifacts.
      - Incorporate secret societies or organizations as appropriate and
        make sure they have clear motives and goals.
      - Keep the players engaged by providing a sense of progression and
        by keeping them on their toes with unexpected twists and turns.
3.  Conclusion:
      - Provide a satisfying resolution to the main objective of the
        adventure.
      - Allow the players to reflect on their accomplishments and the
        impact of their actions on the world.
      - Provide a sense of closure, but also leave room for the
        possibility of further adventures.
      - Reward the players for their actions and provide opportunities
        for them to advance their characters and acquire new abilities
        or artifacts.
      - Provide the players with a clear idea of what happens next and
        what their next steps should be.

## Sites Exploration

### Get Inspired

    research the history and culture of the site to create a believable
    and immersive setting.
2.  **Incorporate puzzles and mysteries**: Many lost civilizations and
    ancient sites are full of puzzles and mysteries for the players to
    solve. These can include deciphering inscriptions, navigating mazes,

    potentially dangerous ruins, so make sure to include hazards and
    traps that can put them in danger.

    elements of the supernatural in the adventure, such as cursed

    and obstacles.

You could also make the society’s headquarters or one of their hidden
bases the location of the Site Exploration, with the objective to
infiltrate, steal information or artifact from them, or sabotage their
plans.

### The Wallet Site Method

Create the site by rolling a handful of d6s and assemble based on
results:

|   |                                              |
| - | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Dead End: Cannot touch more than 1 die       |
| 2 | Passage: Cannot touch more than 2 dice       |
| 3 | Split: Cannot touch more than 3 dice         |
| 4 | Crossroads: Can touch up to 4 dice           |
| 5 | Tower: Stack all, must touch at least 2 dice |
| 6 | Hall: Merge all, can touch up to 4 dice      |

For each die, add its value to all neighboring dice to determine its
room. Halls and Towers are single rooms with all their dice summed.

|       |             |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 3     | Quarters    |
| 4     | Jail        |
| 5     | Sepulchre   |
| 6     | Statuary    |
| 7     | Store Room  |
| 8     | Courtyard   |
| 9     | Kitchen     |
| 10    | Forge       |
| 11    | Armory      |
| 12    | Garden      |
| 13    | Guard Post  |
| 14    | Library     |
| 15    | Arboretum   |
| 16    | Crypts      |
| 17    | Shrine      |
| 18    | Gallery     |
| 19    | Workshop    |
| 20-22 | Temple      |
| 23-25 | Throne Room |
| 26-28 | Laboratory  |
| 29-31 | Menagerie   |
| 32+   | Labyrinth   |

Place an entrance where it makes sense.

For extra detail, modify each room based on lowest/highest neighboring
die.

| 1 2 3 | Lowest      | 4 5 6 | Highest       |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 2     | Secret Exit | 1     | Ornate        |
| 3     | Trapped     | 2     | Pristine      |
| 4     | Crumbling   | 3     | Opulent       |
| 5     | Flooded     | 4     | Hidden Alcove |
| 6     | Damp        | 5     | Locked        |

Roll an **encounter** in each room:

|   |                              |
| - | ---------------------------- |
| 1 | Threat: Active harm          |
| 2 | Obstacle: Passive harm       |
| 3 | Nothing: A moment of respite |
| 4 | Nothing: A moment of respite |
| 5 | Opportunity: Obstacle + Boon |
| 6 | Boon: Helpful or valuable    |

**Tower**: Roll an encounter for each floor, then order them from lowest
to highest.

**Hall**: Roll an encounter for each die in the Hall and combine them.

-----

### Creating Creatures

Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or
NPC:

**Name** X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special items,
qualities) - Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor - Quirk,
tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique - Special effect or
critical damage consequence

**General Principles**  
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is
noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.  
\- Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious
threats get 10+ HP. - Use flavor and style to help them stand out. - Use
critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive
NPC. - Remember that HP is **Hit Protection** , not Hit Points. It’s a
measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

## Rules Summary

**ACTIONS**  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one
action. Actions may include using an artifact, attacking, making a
second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and
movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain,
the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful
DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

**ABILITIES**  
**STR:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.  
**DEX:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.  
**WIL:** Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

**SAVES**  
\- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability. - 1 is always a success, 20
is always a failure.

**HIT PROTECTION**  
**HP** indicates a PC’s ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during
combat & recovered after a few moment’s rest.

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their
backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a
one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two
slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more
than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an
increase in slots.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they
add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts
until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

**HEALING**  
A moment’s rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave
the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week’s rest and the
aid of a medic.

**COMBAT**  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s Armor,
then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor** value
from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a
bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers**
target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest
result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both
damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4,
regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker rolls
1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets,
rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the
[**Scars**](/Golden%20Idol-srd#scars-1) table.

Damage that reduces a target’s HP **below** 0 decreases their STR by the
remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage.**
Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death;** having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is
delirium.

secretive purposes.

Despite its secretive nature, the Order has been known to make its

in ways that are not easily understood. Some believe that the Order is
working towards a greater good, while others see it as a dangerous and
