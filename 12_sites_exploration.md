## Sites Exploration

### Get Inspired
Here are some suggestions for building your exploration site:
1. **Research the site**: Just like with globetrotting adventures, research the history and culture of the site to create a believable and immersive setting.
2. **Incorporate puzzles and mysteries**: Many lost civilizations and ancient sites are full of puzzles and mysteries for the players to solve. These can include deciphering inscriptions, navigating mazes, or solving riddles.
3. **Create a sense of danger**: The players are exploring ancient and potentially dangerous ruins, so make sure to include hazards and traps that can put them in danger.
4. **Incorporate supernatural elements**: The unexplained and supernatural is a key element of the game, so consider including elements of the supernatural in the adventure, such as cursed artifacts or supernatural guardians.
5. **Incorporate conflicts with secret societies and organizations**: Just like in globetrotting adventures, these groups can provide a source of conflict and tension as they may be working against the players to acquire the same artifacts.

### Site Creation Guidelines
If you run out of ideas use the guidelines below for inspiration or build the site from scratch:
1. **Determine the type of site**: Roll a d12 to randomly select the type of site the adventure will take place in.
    * 1-2: Abandoned Temple

    * 5-6: Lost City
    * 7-8: Tomb
    * 9-10: Laboratory
    * 11-12: Cave system
2. **Determine the main objective of the adventure**: Roll a d20 to randomly select a main objective for the adventure.
    * 1-2: Recover a powerful artifact from the site
    * 3-4: Investigate strange supernatural occurrences in the site
    * 5-6: Rescue a team member or ally who has gone missing

    * 1: Linear
    * 2: Maze-like
    * 3: Open with multiple levels
    * 4: Split into multiple connected areas
    * 5: A mix of the above
    * 6: Roll twice and combine
4. **Determine the challenges and obstacles**: Roll a d12 to randomly select a type of challenge or obstacle that the players will encounter during the adventure.
    * 1-2: Environmental hazards (e.g. flooding, cave-ins)
    * 3-4: Conflicts with ancient guardians or traps
    * 5-6: Puzzles and riddles to solve
    * 7-8: Navigation challenges (e.g. dark, underwater)
    * 9-10: Conflicts with other teams or organizations
    * 11-12: Supernatural or unexplained phenomena
5. **Incorporate secret societies or organizations**: Roll a d6 to determine if the adventure will involve a secret society or organization, and if so, roll another d6 to determine which one:
   1. The Brotherhood of the Dragon
   2. The Cult of the Mummy
   3. The Order of the Phoenix
   4. The Society of the Serpent
   5. The Brotherhood of the Obsidian Moon
   6. The Children of the Celestial Flame
6. **Repeat steps 2-5** as necessary to generate additional challenges and obstacles.

You could also make the society's headquarters or one of their hidden bases the location of the Site Exploration, with the objective to infiltrate, steal information or artifact from them, or sabotage their plans.

### The Wallet Site Method

Create the site by rolling a handful of d6s and assemble based on results:

- 1: Dead End: Cannot touch more than 1 die
- 2: Passage: Cannot touch more than 2 dice
- 3: Split: Cannot touch more than 3 dice
- 4: Crossroads: Can touch up to 4 dice
- 5: Tower: Stack all, must touch at least 2 dice
- 6: Hall: Merge all, can touch up to 4 dice

For each die, add its value to all neighboring dice to determine its room. Halls and Towers are single rooms with all their dice summed.
- 3: Quarters
- 4: Jail
- 5: Sepulchre
- 6: Statuary
- 7: Store Room
- 8: Courtyard
- 9: Kitchen
- 10: Forge
- 11: Armory
- 12: Garden
- 13: Guard Post
- 14: Library
- 15: Arboretum
- 16: Crypts
- 17: Shrine
- 18: Gallery
- 19: Workshop
- 20-22: Temple
- 23-25: Throne Room
- 26-28: Laboratory
- 29-31: Menagerie
- 32+: Labyrinth

Place an entrance where it makes sense.

For extra detail, modify each room based on lowest/highest neighboring die.

- 1,2,3: Lowest
  - 2: Secret Exit
  - 3: Trapped
  - 4: Crumbling
  - 5: Flooded
  - 6: Damp
- 4,5,6: Highest
  - 1: Ornate
  - 2: Pristine
  - 3: Opulent
  - 4: Hidden Alcove
  - 5: Locked

Roll an **encounter** in each room:
1. Threat: Active harm
2. Obstacle: Passive harm
3. Nothing: A moment of respite
4. Nothing: A moment of respite
5. Opportunity: Obstacle + Boon
6. Boon: Helpful or valuable

**Tower**: Roll an encounter for each floor, then order them from lowest to highest.

**Hall**: Roll an encounter for each die in the Hall and combine them.
