## Gobletrotting

### Get Inspired
Here are some suggestions for building your adventure:

1. **Research the places involved**: Get a sense of the culture, history, and geography of the places the characters will visit. This will help you create a believable and immersive setting for the adventure.
2. **Make use of the Pointcrawl model**: This model emphasizes the use of points of interest, rather than a linear path, to guide the players through the adventure. This allows for greater flexibility and player agency in the way the adventure unfolds.
3. **Create a variety of challenges and obstacles**: As the players travel to different locations, they should encounter a variety of challenges that reflect the unique aspects of each location. These can include environmental hazards, cultural barriers, or conflicts with locals.
4. **Incorporate artifacts and lost civilizations**: The primary goal of the players is to discover and recover artifacts, so make sure to include opportunities for them to do so in the adventure. Lost civilizations and their remains can also be a source of interesting puzzles and mysteries for the players to solve.
5. **Consider the impact of secret societies and organizations**: These groups can provide a source of conflict and tension throughout the adventure, as they may be working against the players to acquire the same artifacts.

### Adventure Creation Guidelines

1. **Determine the location of the adventure**: Roll a d10 to randomly select a location from a list of possible locations around the world.

By using these mechanical rules, you can randomly generate a unique and exciting globetrotting adventure in Golden Idol that incorporates the key elements of the game, such as artifacts, lost civilizations, secret societies, and the unexplained and supernatural.

### A More Cinematic Guideline
Golden Idol is a "fiction first" game where events and situations interacting with characters through their actions make a narrative emerge.
This is why I strongly advise against writing a "plot" for the characters to follow: create situations and obstacles and let events unfold.
But if you can't resist the temptation to at least give the adventure an outline, consider the following suggestions for a classic three-act story.

I just urge you not to consider them rigid or mandatory.

1. Introduction:
    - Establish the main objective of the adventure clearly and concisely.
    - Provide the players with enough information about the location and any relevant background information to immerse them in the setting.
    - Introduce any key NPCs or organizations that will be involved in the adventure.
    - Provide the players with a sense of urgency or motivation to start the adventure.
    - Give the players a clear starting point and a general idea of where they should go next, but also leave room for exploration and player agency.
2. Middle:
    - Allow the players to explore the location and discover points of interest on their own.
    - Introduce challenges and obstacles that are appropriate for the location and the main objective of the adventure.
    - Provide opportunities for the players to discover and recover artifacts.
    - Incorporate secret societies or organizations as appropriate and make sure they have clear motives and goals.
    - Keep the players engaged by providing a sense of progression and by keeping them on their toes with unexpected twists and turns.
3. Conclusion:
    - Provide a satisfying resolution to the main objective of the adventure.
    - Allow the players to reflect on their accomplishments and the impact of their actions on the world.
    - Provide a sense of closure, but also leave room for the possibility of further adventures.
    - Reward the players for their actions and provide opportunities for them to advance their characters and acquire new abilities or artifacts.
    - Provide the players with a clear idea of what happens next and what their next steps should be.
