## Gobletrotting

1. Research the location: Get a sense of the culture, history, and geography of the location. This will help you create a believable and immersive setting for the adventure.
2. Make use of the Pointcrawl model: This model emphasizes the use of points of interest, rather than a linear path, to guide the players through the adventure. This allows for greater flexibility and player agency in the way the adventure unfolds.
3. Create a variety of challenges and obstacles: As the players travel to different locations, they should encounter a variety of challenges that reflect the unique aspects of each location. These can include environmental hazards, cultural barriers, or conflicts with locals.
4. Incorporate artifacts and lost civilizations: The primary goal of the players is to discover and recover artifacts, so make sure to include opportunities for them to do so in the adventure. Lost civilizations and their remains can also be a source of interesting puzzles and mysteries for the players to solve.
5. Consider the impact of secret societies and organizations: These groups can provide a source of conflict and tension throughout the adventure, as they may be working against the players to acquire the same artifacts.
