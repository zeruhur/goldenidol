## Vehicles

Like creatures, vehicles have three abilities used to make saves.
- **Integrity** (INT): General stability, used to crash safely, smash through things, and resist Critical Damage. Equivalent to STR for creatures.
- **Engines** (ENG): Ability to move, speed up, dodge, and stunts. Equivalent to DEX for creatures.
- **Gauges** (GAU): Mechanical control components. Used to maintain routes, stabilize assets, etc. Equivalent to WIL for creatures.

Vehicles also possess:
- Hull Points (**HP**) which reflect their ability to avoid damage in combat.
- **Armor** which reduces damage (max 3) before affecting HP.
- **Load**, the capacity of the vehicle:
  - 1 slot per person or 100lb of weight.
  - Exceeding the total value of Load, the vehicle is overloaded and it is unable to recover HP or ability scores.

**Damage** that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's INT by the amount remaining. 
- They must then make a INT save to avoid critical damage. 
- Any vehicle that suffers critical damage trudges and spits oil. If left unrepaired, it is destroyed within the 1d20 minutes.
- A vehicle with zero INT is totaled.
